# aspect-ratio-bbq

It is a project from Scrimba Frontend Path: Responsive Design \
where I tested media queries using aspect-ratio.

I added a simple script for the inner window size.\
(With dynamic text at the right-bottom corner, responsive to resizes)\
It is a work in progress for the aspect-ratio responsiveness.\
For instance with a narrow layout it will load fine on mobile,\
but with the vertical text not flowing correctly! (To be fixed).

Of course, the form is not connected to anything.
