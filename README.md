# aspect-ratio-bbq

It is a practice of a course project from Scrimba (Frontend Path).\
I am studying conditional device pixel ratio and image resolution using that setup.\
Hosted on: [https://stellar-kheer-7b0eee.netlify.app/](https://stellar-kheer-7b0eee.netlify.app/)

Because the browser Dev Tools inspector (Chrome, Firefox) only shows pixel sizes,\
I added a simple script that detects the local inner window size and devicePixelRatio:\
[devicepixelratio.js](../main/devicepixelratio.js)
(It is responsive to resizes, with dynamic text. Look down at the bottom-left corner.\

Of course, the input form is not connected to anything.
